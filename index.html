 <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  </u>
  
 <body>
  <p>Electronic waste or e-waste is generated when electronic and electrical equipment become unfit
   for their originally intended use or have crossed the expiry date. Computers, servers, mainframes, monitors, 
   compact discs (CDs), printers, scanners, copiers, calculators, fax machines, battery cells, cellular phones, transceivers, TVs, 
   iPods, medical apparatus, washing machines, refrigerators, and air conditioners are examples of e-waste (when unfit for use). These electro
   nic equipments get fast replaced with newer models due to the rapid technology advancements and production of newer electronic equipment. This h
   as led to an exponential increase in e-waste generation. People tend to switch over to the newer models and the life of products has also decreased.</p>
  <u><h2> WHAT IS E-WASTE</h2></u>
 <p>E-waste is any electrical or electronic equipment that’s been discarded. 
  This includes working and broken items that are thrown in the garbage or
   donated to a charity reseller like Goodwill. Often, if the item goes unsold in the store, it will be throw
  n away. E-waste is particularly dangerous due to toxic chemicals that naturally leach from the metals inside when buried.</p>

  <h3>TYPES OF E-WASTE</h3>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Major appliances (refrigerators, washing machines, dryers etc.)</li>
  <li> Small appliances (vacuum cleaners, irons, blenders, fryers etc.)</li>
  <li> Computer and telecommunication appliances (laptops, PCs, telephones, mobile phones etc).</li>
  <li> Consumer electronics (video and audio equipment, musical instruments)</li>
  <li>Lighting devices (incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent tubes, gas-discharge lamps etc.)</li>
  <li> Electrical and electronic tools (drills, saws, gardening devices etc.)</li>
  <li> Toys, leisure (electronic toys, models, sports equipment)</li>
  <li> Medical devices (all medical equipment with the exception of implants)</li>
  <li> Monitoring devices (detectors, thermostats, laboratory equipment etc.)</li>
 <li> Vending machine</li>

  <h3>EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTS</h3>
<p>Disposal of e-wastes is a particular problem faced in many regions across the globe. Computer wastes that are land filled produces contaminated leachates. which eventually pollute the groundwater. Acids and sludge obtained from melting computer chips, if disposed on the ground causes acidification of soil. For example, Guiyu. Hong Kong a thriving area of illegal e-waste recycling is facing acute water shortages due to the contamination of water resources. This is due to disposal of recycling wastes such as acids, sludges etc. in rivers. Now water is being transported from faraway towns to cater to the demands of the population. Incineration of e-wastes can emit toxic fumes and gases, thereby polluting the surrounding air. Improperly monitored landfills can cause environmental hazards. Mercury will leach when certain electronic devices, such as circuit breakers are destroyed. The same is true for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from condensers. When brominated flame retardant plastic or cadmium containing plastics are landfilled, both polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and cadmium may leach into the soil and groundwater. It has been found that significant amounts of lead ion are dissolved from broken lead containing glass,
such as the cone glass of cathode ray tubes, gets mixed with acid waters and are a common occurrence in landfills. Not only does the leaching of mercury poses specific problems, the vaporization of metallic mercury and dimethylene mercury, both part of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is also of concern. In addition, uncontrolled fires may arise at landfills and this could be a frequent occurrence in many countries. When exposed to fire, metals and other chemical substances, such as the extremely toxic dioxins and furans (TCDD- tetrachloro-dibenzo-dioxin. PCDDs - polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins. PBDDs-polybrominated dibenzo-dioxin and PCDFs -polychlorinated dibenzo furans) from halogenated flame-retardant products and PCB containing condensers can be emitted. The most dangerous form of burning e-waste is the open-air burning of plastics in order to recover copper and other metals. The toxic fall-out from open air burning affects both the local environment and broader global air currents, depositing highly toxic by-products in many places throughout the world. 
  </p><p> If these electronic items are discarded with other household garbage, the toxics pose E-Waste Management a threat to both health and vital components of the ecosystem. In view of the ill-effects of hazardous wastes to both environment and health, several countries exhorted the need for a global agreement to address the problems and challenges posed by hazardous waste. Also, in the late 1980s, a tightening of environmental regulations in industrialized countries led to a dramatic rise in the cost of hazardous waste disposal. Searching for cheaper ways to get rid of the wastes, "toxic traders" began shipping hazardous waste to developing countries. International outrage following these irresponsible activities led to the drafting and adoption of strategic plans and regulations at the Basel Convention. The Convention secretariat, in Geneva, Switzerland, facilitates and implementation of the Convention and related agreements. It also provides assistance and guidelines on legal and technical issues, gathers statistical data, and conducts training on the proper management of hazardous waste.

 <h3>CONDITION IN INDIA </h3>
<p>In India, the quantity of “e-waste” or electronic waste has now become a major problem. Disposal of e-waste is an emerging global environmental and public health issue, as this waste has become the most rapidly growing segment of the formal municipal waste stream in the world. India ranks 177 amongst 180 countries and is amongst the bottom five countries on the Environmental Performance Index 2018, as per a report released at the World Economic Forum 2018. This was linked to poor performance in the environment health policy and deaths due to air pollution categories. Also, India is ranked fifth in the world amongst top e-waste producing countries after the USA, China, Japan, and Germany and recycles less than 2 per cent of the total e-waste it produces annually formally. Since 2018, India generates more than two million tonnes of e-waste annually, and also imports huge amounts of e-waste from other countries around the world. 
 </p><h3>WHAT TO DO NEXT </h3>
<p>E-waste also contains plastic, up to nearly 25 per cent of its weight. Novel recovery and conversion of e-waste plastics to value-added products have also been successfully developed. 
The developed process is capable of converting a majority (76 per cent) of the waste plastics into suitable materials, which could be used for virgin plastic products. The technology has already been transferred for commercialisation. Professor Veena Sahajwalla, an expert, based in Australia, suggests setting up micro-factories in India that can transform e-waste into reusable material to be converted into ceramics and plastic filaments for 3D printing. 
The high-grade metals — like gold, silver, copper and palladium — in the e-waste can be separated for re-sale in conditions that are totally safe. Since India is highly deficient in precious mineral resources (whereas untreated e-waste goes to landfill), there is need for a well designed, robust and regulated e-waste recovery regime which would generate jobs as well as wealth. 
 </p><h3>MANAGEMENT OF E-WASTE</h3>
 <p>
It is estimated that 75% of electronic items are stored due to uncertainty of how to manage it. These electronic junks lie unattended in houses, offices, warehouses etc. and normally mixed with household wastes, which is finally disposed off at landfills. This necessitates implement able management measures.
 </p><p>In industries management of e-waste should begin at the point of generation. This can be done by waste minimization techniques and by sustainable product design.
