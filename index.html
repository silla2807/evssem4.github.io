  <p>Electronic waste or e-waste is generated when electronic and electrical equipment becomes unfit for its originally intended use or has crossed the expiry date. These electronic equipment get fast replaced with newer models due to the rapid technology advancements and production of newer electronic equipment. This has led to an exponential increase in e-waste generation. People tend to switch over to the newer models and the life of products has also decreased.

 <p>E-waste is any electrical or electronic equipment that’s been discarded.   Computers, servers, mainframes, monitors, compact discs (CDs), printers, scanners, copiers, calculators, fax machines, battery cells, cellular phones, transceivers, TVs, iPods, medical apparatus, washing machines, refrigerators, and air conditioners are examples of e-waste (when unfit for use).Often, if the item goes unsold in the store, it will be thrown away. E-waste is particularly precarious due to toxic chemicals that naturally strain from the metals inside when buried.

  <h3>TYPES OF E-WASTE</h3>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Major appliances (refrigerators, washing machines, dryers etc.)</li>
  <li> Small appliances (vacuum cleaners, irons, blenders, fryers etc.)</li>
  <li> Computer and telecommunication appliances (laptops, PCs, telephones, mobile phones etc).</li>
  <li> Consumer electronics (video and audio equipment, musical instruments)</li>
  <li>Lighting devices (incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent tubes, gas-discharge lamps etc.)</li>
  <li> Electrical and electronic tools (drills, saws, gardening devices etc.)</li>
  <li> Toys, leisure (electronic toys, models, sports equipment)</li>
  <li> Medical devices (all medical equipment with the exception of implants)</li>
  <li> Monitoring devices (detectors, thermostats, laboratory equipment etc.)</li>
 <li> Vending machine</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTS</h3>
<p>Disposal of e-waste is a particular problem faced in many regions across the globe. Computer wastes that are land-filled produce contaminated leachates. which eventually pollute the groundwater. Acids and sludge obtained from melting computer chips, if disposed of on the ground causes acidification of soil. For example, Guiyu. Hong Kong, a thriving area of illegal e-waste recycling is facing acute water shortages due to the contamination of water resources. This is due to the disposal of recycling wastes such as acids, sludges, etc. in rivers. Now water is being transported from faraway towns to cater to the demands of the population. Incineration of e-wastes can emit toxic fumes and gases, thereby polluting the surrounding air. Improperly monitored landfills can cause environmental hazards. Mercury will leach when certain electronic devices, such as circuit breakers are destroyed. The same is true for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from condensers. When brominated flame retardant plastic or cadmium-containing plastics are landfilled, both polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and cadmium may leach into the soil and groundwater. It has been found that significant amounts of lead ions are dissolved from broken lead-containing glass, such as the cone glass of cathode ray tubes, gets mixed with acid waters, and are a common occurrence in landfills. Not only does the leaching of mercury poses specific problems, the vaporization of metallic mercury and dimethylene mercury, both parts of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is also of concern. Besides, uncontrolled fires may arise at landfills and this could be a frequent occurrence in many countries. When exposed to fire, metals and other chemical substances, such as the extremely toxic dioxins and furans (TCDD- tetrachloro-dibenzo-dioxin. PCDDs - polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins. PBDDs-polybrominated dibenzo-dioxin and PCDFs -polychlorinated dibenzofurans) from halogenated flame-retardant products and PCB containing condensers can be emitted. The most dangerous form of burning e-waste is the open-air burning of plastics to recover copper and other metals. The toxic fall-out from open-air burning affects both the local environment and broader global air currents, depositing highly toxic by-products in many places throughout the world.


  </p><p> If these electronic items are discarded with other household garbage, the toxins pose E-Waste Management a threat to both health and vital components of the ecosystem. Because of the ill-effects of hazardous wastes on both environment and health, several countries exhorted the need for a global agreement to address the problems and challenges posed by hazardous waste. Also, in the late 1980s, a tightening of environmental regulations in industrialized countries led to a dramatic rise in the cost of hazardous waste disposal. Searching for cheaper ways to get rid of the wastes, "toxic traders" began shipping hazardous waste to developing countries. International outrage following these irresponsible activities led to the drafting and adoption of strategic plans and regulations at the Basel Convention. The Convention secretariat, in Geneva, Switzerland, facilitates and implementation of the Convention and related agreements. It also provides assistance and guidelines on legal and technical issues, gathers statistical data, and conducts training on the proper management of hazardous waste.

 <h3>CONDITION IN INDIA </h3>
<p>In India, the quantity of “e-waste” or electronic waste has now become a major problem. The disposal of e-waste is an emerging global environmental and public health issue, as this waste has become the most rapidly growing segment of the formal municipal waste stream in the world. India ranks 177 amongst 180 countries and is amongst the bottom five countries on the Environmental Performance Index 2018, as per a report released at the World Economic Forum 2018. This was linked to poor performance in the environment health policy and deaths due to air pollution categories. Also, India is ranked fifth in the world amongst top e-waste producing countries after the USA, China, Japan, and Germany and recycles less than 2 percent of the total e-waste it produces annually formally. Since 2018, India has generated more than two million tonnes of e-waste annually and also imports huge amounts of e-waste from other countries around the world.
E-waste collection, transportation, processing, and recycling is dominated by the informal sector. The sector is well networked and unregulated. Often, all the materials and value that could be potentially recovered is not recovered. In addition, there are serious issues regarding leakages of toxins into the environment and workers’ safety and health.

Seelampur in Delhi is the largest e-waste dismantling centre of India. Adults as well as children spend 8–10 hours daily extracting reusable components and precious metals like copper, gold and various functional parts from the devices. E-waste recyclers use processes such as open incineration and acid-leeching. This situation could be improved by creating awareness and improving the infrastructure of recycling units along with the prevalent policies. The majority of the e-waste collected in India is managed by an unorganized sector
 </p><h3>MANAGEMENT OF E-WASTE</h3>

 <p>
It is estimated that 75% of electronic items are stored due to uncertainty of how to manage them. These electronic junks lie unattended in houses, offices, warehouses, etc., and are normally mixed with household wastes, which are finally disposed of at landfills. This necessitates implementing able management measures.

 <p>In industries management of e-waste should begin at the point of generation. This can be done by waste minimization techniques and by sustainable product design. Waste minimization in industries involves adopting:
</p>
<dl>
 <dd>•	Inventory management</dd>
 <dd>•	production-process modification,</dd>
 <dd>•	volume reduction,</dd>
 <dd>•	recovery and reuse.</dd>
 </dl>
 <ol>
  <li><b>Inventory management</b>
<p>Proper control over the materials used in the manufacturing process is an important way to reduce waste generation (Freeman, 1989). By reducing both the number of hazardous materials used in the process and the amount of excess raw materials in stock, the quantity of waste generated can be reduced. This can be done in two ways i.e. establishing material-purchase review and control procedures and inventory tracking system. Developing review procedures for all material purchased is the first step in establishing an inventory management program. Procedures should require that all materials be approved before purchase. In the approval process, all production materials are evaluated to examine if they contain hazardous constituents and whether alternative non-hazardous materials are available. Another inventory management procedure for waste reduction is to ensure that only the needed quantity of material is ordered. This will require the establishment of a strict inventory tracking system. Purchase procedures must be implemented which ensure that materials are ordered only on an as-needed basis and that only the amount needed for a specific period is ordered.
   </p> </li><li> <b>Production-process modification</b>
<p>Changes can be made in the production process, which will reduce waste generation. This reduction can be accomplished by changing the materials used to make the product or by the more efficient use of input materials in the production process or both. Potential waste - minimization techniques can be broken down into three categories:
  </p></li>
  <dl>
   <dd>i)Improved operating and maintenance procedures, </dd>
   <dd>ii) Material change and</dd>
   <dd> iii)Process-equipment modification.</dd>
  </dl>
<p>Improvements in the operation and maintenance of process equipment can result in significant waste reduction. This can be accomplished by reviewing current operational procedures or lack of procedures and examination of the production process for ways to improve its efficiency. Instituting standard operating procedures can optimize the use of raw materials in the production process and reduce the potential for materials to be lost through leaks and spills. A strict maintenance program, which stresses corrective maintenance, can reduce waste generation caused by equipment failure. An employee-training program is a key element of any waste reduction program. Training should include correct operating and handling procedures, proper equipment recommended maintenance and inspection schedules, correct process control specifications, and proper management of waste materials. Hazardous materials used in either a product formulation or a production process may be replaced with less hazardous or non-hazardous material. This is a very widely used technique and applies to most manufacturing processes. Implementation of this waste reduction technique may require only some minor process adjustments or it may require extensive new process equipment. For example, a circuit board manufacturer can replace solvent-based products with water-based flux and simultaneously replace solvent-vapor degreaser with detergent parts washer. Installing more efficient process equipment or modifying existing equipment to take advantage of better production techniques can significantly reduce waste generation. New or updated equipment can use process materials more efficiently, producing less waste. Additionally, such efficiency reduces the number of rejected or off-specification products, thereby reducing the amount of material that has to be reworked or disposed of. Modifying existing process equipment can be a very cost-effective method of reducing waste generation. In many cases, the modification can just be relatively simple changes in the way the materials are handled within the process to ensure that they are not wasted. For example, in many electronic manufacturing operations, which involve coating a product, such as electroplating or painting, chemicals are used to strip off coating from rejected products so that they can be recoated. These chemicals, which can include acids, caustics, cyanides, etc are often hazardous waste and must be properly managed. By reducing the number of parts that have to be reworked, the quantity of waste can be significantly reduced.
  </p><li> <b>Volume reduction</b><p>
Volume reduction includes those techniques that remove the hazardous portion of waste from a non-hazardous portion. These techniques are usually to reduce the volume, and thus the cost of disposing of, a waste material. The techniques that can be used to reduce waste-stream volume can be divided into 2 general categories: source segregation and waste concentration. Segregation of wastes is in many cases a simple and economical technique for waste reduction. Wastes containing different types of metals can be treated separately so that the metal value in the sludge can be recovered. The concentration of a waste stream may increase the likelihood that the material can be recycled or reused. Methods include gravity and vacuum filtration, ultra-filtration, reverse osmosis, freeze vaporization, etc. For example, an electronic component manufacturer can use compaction equipment to reduce the volume of waste cathode ray tubes.

</p></li>
  <li> <b>Recovery and Reuse</b><p>
This technique could eliminate waste disposal costs, reduce raw material costs and provide income from salable waste. Waste can be recovered on-site, or at an off-site recovery facility, or through the inter-industry exchange. Several physical and chemical techniques are available to reclaim a waste material such as reverse osmosis, electrolysis, condensation, electrolytic recovery, filtration, centrifugation, etc. For example, a printed circuit board manufacturer can use electrolytic recovery to reclaim metals from copper and tin-lead plating bath. However, recycling hazardous products have little environmental benefit- it simply moves the hazards into secondary products that eventually have to be disposed of. Unless the goal is to redesign the product to use non-hazardous materials, such recycling is a false solution.

 <h3>E-WASTE MANAGEMENT RULES IN INDIA</h3>
<p> The government passed the first law on e-waste management in 2011, based on Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), which put the onus on the producer for the management of the final stages of the life of its product, in an eco-friendly way, by creating certain norms in tandem with state pollution control boards.
E-waste (Management) Rules, 2016, enacted since October 1, 2017, had further strengthened the existing rules. Over 21 products (Schedule-I) were included under the purview of the rule. The rule also extended its purview to components or consumables or parts or spares of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE), along with their products. On March 22, 2018, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) amended the E-Waste Management Rules, 2016. These rules will be further called E-Waste (Management) Amendment Rules, 2018. 
 </p>

<p> The majority of the brands operating in India do not have a tangible EPR in place for taking back or managing their end-of-life EEE. A recent study by non-profit Toxics Link found out that despite having a take-back system in place, it does not function for most brands. The producers/manufacturers do not have adequate information on their website, customer care representatives do not have an inkling about any take-back or recycling program and even if they have set up collection centers, they are simply not enough for a geographically vast country like India. “India is a vast country, setting up a collection mechanism is a big challenge. If any of the brands try individually to reach out to all corners of the country, it will economically not be sustainable or feasible,” says Priti Mahesh, senior program coordinator, Toxics Link. Another major question in e-waste management in India is how to include thousands of producers and importers under the ambit of regulation.
<p>Mobile phone manufacturer Nokia is one of the very few companies that seem to have made serious effort in this direction since 2008. The companies were made responsible for creating channels for proper collection and disposal of e-waste in accordance with a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) approved EPR Authorization plan in India. Recently, the import license of some of the big companies were suspended for violation of E-waste rules. Such measures have a great impact on effective implementation of e-waste management in India.
 </p>
 </p><h4>CASE STUDY OF NORWAY</h4> 
<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">The Ministry of Environment in Norway signed an agreement to set up take-back companies with the producers and importers of electronic waste as early as 1998. It was a voluntary agreement and was later followed by an e-waste regulation in 1999. Like the rules in India, management of e-waste in Norway is also a producer responsibility, and producers are defined as Norwegian manufacturers and importers of EEE. “EPR implementation in Norway mandates the domestic producers and importers to finance the e-waste collection and treatment systems. The financing can happen individually or collectively,” says Silje Johanssen, an advisor with the Section for Waste and Biocides, Norwegian Environment Agency (NEA). Silje explains that producers/importers of e-waste in Norway are obliged to be members of a take-back company and have to pay a fee for their membership to the take-back companies. This is how it provides the funding for the collection and treatment of waste. The membership price differs according to product type. Currently, there are five approved take-back companies in Norway with 5000 member producers/importers." The process, however, is not a simple one. Before starting, the take-back companies in Norway need to get approval from the NEA. The approval process includes verification of nearly about 50 criteria besides a third party having to certify them. The process includes providing a plan detailing how they will collect e-waste and treat it in an environmentally sound way. They also need to ensure that they will collect all e-waste from their market share which is determined by how much electronics is put into the market by their members. The take-back companies report back to Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) register and also finance the WEEE register. The WEEE register, however, is managed by the government and maintains all records regarding e-waste in the country.
 </p>
<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">In Contrast, India does not have any data on the electronics being manufactured and imported into the country. There is no national registry taking account of the producers operating in the country and the amount of EEE introduced by them in the market.

 </p><h2>FINAL OBSERVATION </h2>
<p> Electronic waste disposal is one of the major complications that is being arisen in this world. Because it is encompassing the existence of this earth and the people on it.  The technological advancements and discoveries boost  the piling up of  e-waste, but  inventions are beneficial to human society. Therefore, we have to dispose  the E-waste in a pragmatic and standardized manner considering the potential risks of the procedures.
 </p><p>Increasing information campaigns, capacity building, and awareness is critical to promote environment friendly e-waste management programmes. Increasing efforts are urgently required on improvement of the current practices such as collection schemes and management practices to reduce the illegal trade of e-waste. Reducing the amount of hazardous substances in e-products will also have a positive effect in dealing with the specific e-waste streams since it will support the prevention process.
 </p><p> E-waste also contains plastic, up to nearly 25 percent of its weight. Novel recovery and conversion of e-waste plastics to value-added products have also been successfully developed. The developed process is capable of converting a majority (76 percent) of the waste plastics into suitable materials, which could be used for virgin plastic products. The technology has already been transferred for commercialization. Professor Veena Sahajwalla, an expert, based in Australia, suggests setting up micro-factories in India that can transform e-waste into reusable material to be converted into ceramics and plastic filaments for 3D printing. The high-grade metals — like gold, silver, copper, and palladium — in the e-waste can be separated for resale in totally safe conditions. Since India is highly deficient in precious mineral resources (whereas untreated e-waste goes to landfills), there is a need for a well-designed, robust, and regulated e-waste recovery regime that would generate jobs as well as wealth.
