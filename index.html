 <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  </u>
  
 <body>
  <p>Electronic waste or e-waste is generated when electronic and electrical equipment become unfit
   for their originally intended use or have crossed the expiry date. Computers, servers, mainframes, monitors, 
   compact discs (CDs), printers, scanners, copiers, calculators, fax machines, battery cells, cellular phones, transceivers, TVs, 
   iPods, medical apparatus, washing machines, refrigerators, and air conditioners are examples of e-waste (when unfit for use). These electro
   nic equipments get fast replaced with newer models due to the rapid technology advancements and production of newer electronic equipment. This h
   as led to an exponential increase in e-waste generation. People tend to switch over to the newer models and the life of products has also decreased.</p>
  <u><h2> WHAT IS E-WASTE</h2></u>
 <p>E-waste is any electrical or electronic equipment thatâ€™s been discarded. 
  This includes working and broken items that are thrown in the garbage or
   donated to a charity reseller like Goodwill. Often, if the item goes unsold in the store, it will be throw
  n away. E-waste is particularly dangerous due to toxic chemicals that naturally leach from the metals inside when buried.</p>
