 <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  </u>
  
 <body>
  <p>Electronic waste or e-waste is generated when electronic and electrical equipment become unfit
   for their originally intended use or have crossed the expiry date. Computers, servers, mainframes, monitors, 
   compact discs (CDs), printers, scanners, copiers, calculators, fax machines, battery cells, cellular phones, transceivers, TVs, 
   iPods, medical apparatus, washing machines, refrigerators, and air conditioners are examples of e-waste (when unfit for use). These electro
   nic equipments get fast replaced with newer models due to the rapid technology advancements and production of newer electronic equipment. This h
   as led to an exponential increase in e-waste generation. People tend to switch over to the newer models and the life of products has also decreased.</p>
  <u><h2> WHAT IS E-WASTE</h2></u>
 <p>E-waste is any electrical or electronic equipment thatâ€™s been discarded. 
  This includes working and broken items that are thrown in the garbage or
   donated to a charity reseller like Goodwill. Often, if the item goes unsold in the store, it will be throw
  n away. E-waste is particularly dangerous due to toxic chemicals that naturally leach from the metals inside when buried.</p>

  <h3>TYPES OF E-WASTE</h3>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Major appliances (refrigerators, washing machines, dryers etc.)</li>
  <li> Small appliances (vacuum cleaners, irons, blenders, fryers etc.)</li>
  <li> Computer and telecommunication appliances (laptops, PCs, telephones, mobile phones etc).</li>
  <li> Consumer electronics (video and audio equipment, musical instruments)</li>
  <li>Lighting devices (incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent tubes, gas-discharge lamps etc.)</li>
  <li> Electrical and electronic tools (drills, saws, gardening devices etc.)</li>
  <li> Toys, leisure (electronic toys, models, sports equipment)</li>
  <li> Medical devices (all medical equipment with the exception of implants)</li>
  <li> Monitoring devices (detectors, thermostats, laboratory equipment etc.)</li>
 <li> Vending machine</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTS</h3>
<p>Disposal of e-wastes is a particular problem faced in many regions across the globe. Computer wastes that are land filled produces contaminated leachates. which eventually pollute the groundwater. Acids and sludge obtained from melting computer chips, if disposed on the ground causes acidification of soil. For example, Guiyu. Hong Kong a thriving area of illegal e-waste recycling is facing acute water shortages due to the contamination of water resources. This is due to disposal of recycling wastes such as acids, sludges etc. in rivers. Now water is being transported from faraway towns to cater to the demands of the population. Incineration of e-wastes can emit toxic fumes and gases, thereby polluting the surrounding air. Improperly monitored landfills can cause environmental hazards. Mercury will leach when certain electronic devices, such as circuit breakers are destroyed. The same is true for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from condensers. When brominated flame retardant plastic or cadmium containing plastics are landfilled, both polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and cadmium may leach into the soil and groundwater. It has been found that significant amounts of lead ion are dissolved from broken lead containing glass,
such as the cone glass of cathode ray tubes, gets mixed with acid waters and are a common occurrence in landfills. Not only does the leaching of mercury poses specific problems, the vaporization of metallic mercury and dimethylene mercury, both part of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is also of concern. In addition, uncontrolled fires may arise at landfills and this could be a frequent occurrence in many countries. When exposed to fire, metals and other chemical substances, such as the extremely toxic dioxins and furans (TCDD- tetrachloro-dibenzo-dioxin. PCDDs - polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins. PBDDs-polybrominated dibenzo-dioxin and PCDFs -polychlorinated dibenzo furans) from halogenated flame-retardant products and PCB containing condensers can be emitted. The most dangerous form of burning e-waste is the open-air burning of plastics in order to recover copper and other metals. The toxic fall-out from open air burning affects both the local environment and broader global air currents, depositing highly toxic by-products in many places throughout the world. 
  </p><p> The table given below summarises the health effects of certain constituents in e-wastes. If these electronic items are discarded with other household garbage, the toxics pose E-Waste Management a threat to both health and vital components of the ecosystem. In view of the ill-effects of hazardous wastes to both environment and health, several countries exhorted the need for a global agreement to address the problems and challenges posed by hazardous waste. Also, in the late 1980s, a tightening of environmental regulations in industrialized countries led to a dramatic rise in the cost of hazardous waste disposal. Searching for cheaper ways to get rid of the wastes, "toxic traders" began shipping hazardous waste to developing countries. International outrage following these irresponsible activities led to the drafting and adoption of strategic plans and regulations at the Basel Convention. The Convention secretariat, in Geneva, Switzerland, facilitates and implementation of the Convention and related agreements. It also provides assistance and guidelines on legal and technical issues, gathers statistical data, and conducts training on the proper management of hazardous waste.
